    <!--The original code obtained from google search AI was:
    <div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: red;"></div> 
    where I was trying to create a red square. I then played with the dimensions
    and color to create something artistic and fun. I eventually figured out
    that you can put text in the div areas, so I wrote a funny little statement
    that feels a bit like a cheesy poem. -->
